Day 1 challenge is to build a captcha system that takes a sequence of numbers as input and if the number on the right of anohter number
are identical, that number will be added to the final sum. And the last number in the sequence is next to the first number as the sequence
is circular.

e.g. 24402, final sum is 6.
